   <h2>Kekuli Bay Provincial Park</h2>
   
    <p>
     <img src="images/kekuli.jpg" alt="Kekuli Lakeview" width="400" height="268" class="floatleft">This is the smallest of the Provincial Parks in the area at 57ha, but this park is known for its camping and boating in which I will provide some details below. Located close to town, about a 10 minute drive south of downtown Vernon just off of the main highway, amenities are close by to stock up on marshmallows to roast. There are plenty of campsites, a few with electrical hook ups and a boat launch that is easily accessible, it is the perfect place to set roots for an RV camping experience. As you can see on the <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/kekuli_bay/kekuli-campground-map.pdf?v=1479324848672" class="nav" target="_blank">Park Map</a>, this is mainly a tourist spot. A good place to set up camp and enjoy the water. Locals tend to steer clear during the summer time and stick to the hidden spots away from all the hustle and bustle.
     </p>
     <p>Kekuli used to be known as Kalamalka West Provincial Park. It was renamed thanks to a "Name the Park" contest with the local students. The name refers to the semi-subterranean homes that interior Salish natives built in the area which are known as Kekuli. Located on Kalamalka lake, a glacier lake that is ever changing in color. Known as a Marl Lake, it changes color due to the limestone deposits reacting to change in temperatures.  During the warm summer months the water changes to a bright blue green colour, with areas varying in hues and tones proves to be a feast for the eyes.

     <h3>Boating
     </h3>
    <p>Arguably the best boat launch on Kalamalka lake, it provides 2 large docks with a large 2 lane concrete launch ramp. This is a popular tourist spot to set up camp with boating and water-skiing as your main interest. Canoes, Kayaks and motor boats of all types are permitted on this lake. You will see a ton of them pulling along water-skiers and floaties skipping across the water. Or bring along your fishing gear and try your luck at catching a trophy sized Rainbow Trout for dinner! Over 1.5km<sup>3</sup> of water to explore! This lake is connected to another lake, Wood Lake, via the Oyama canal so can take a boat tour over 2 lakes with no need to load back up again.
    </p>
     <h3>Camping
     </h3>
    <p>If you are looking for a nice isolated place to set up camp, this is not the place you should go. This campground is quite large, with over 70 dedicated campsites you shouldn't expect total privacy and quiet atmosphere. This is a great place for families to camp, make new friends and create memories. The area between the campsites are neatly landscaped grassy areas with young trees that provide a little bit of shade. Most of the park is wide open with little relief from the sun, so umbrellas, plenty of water and sunscreen is highly recommended. There are showers, flush toilets and a playground to enjoy as well.
