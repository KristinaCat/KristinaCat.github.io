   <h2>Ellison Provincial Park</h2>
   
   <p>
    <img src="images/ellison.jpg" alt="View of lake" width="400" height="300" class="floatleft">This is by far one of my favorite places to be. No matter where in the park you are, even the worst camera captures the most amazing pictures, no filter needed! Located about a 20 minute drive from downtown Vernon on the North-East shore of the magnificent Okanagan Lake. Over 220 hectares of Mother Nature showcasing a variety of terrain types, something for all levels of fitness. The terrain also is home to many types of animal and plant life. Not uncommon to see deer, porcupines and birds of all varieties. Bears and cougars are also native to the area, but normally keep clear of the populated areas. Along with the below mentioned opportunities to experience in Ellison Provincial Park, There is so much more to discover. Canoeing, kayaking, fishing, and a well-kept playground area are others to explore. Whether you are looking to relax and take it easy or get some exercise in, As you can see Ellison has many options to choose from.

    <h3>Hiking
    </h3>
   <p>Ellison boasts over 60 km of trails that wind throughout the park, up the rocky bluffs through the woods and down to the lake. Not seen on this <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/ellison/ellison.pdf?v=1479777658354" class="nav" target="_blank">Park Map</a>, the trails also continue across the paved road and up the mountain. Along the way you will have plenty of opportunities to sit and take a break while still soaking up the panoramic views of the surrounding mountain ranges and Okanagan Lake. Most of the trails are easy to moderate, but there are a few sections of steep incline. A little bit of work to get up to the high points, but it will be the high point of your visit to the park.

    <h3>Climbing
    </h3>
   <p>There are some granite cliffs at the South Bay section of the park that provide a great area for sport and traditional climbing. I am not at all familiar with rock/mountain climbing, but this is a must mention to show the diverse activity options in this park. Recommend to check out <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/North_America/Canada/British_Columbia/Okanagan/Ellison_Provincal_Park/Main_Cliff" class="nav" target="_blank">RockClimbing.com</a> for more details!
   </p>
   <h3>Biking
   </h3>
   <p>There are numerous spectacular mountain biking trails throughout Ellison. 38 to be exact, at a combined distance of over 60 km, there is plenty of varying terrain and trail lengths catering to all skill levels. Ellison gets an early start to the riding season, it has the pleasure of being the first to thaw out in springtime, and the last to get snow in winter. <a href="http://www.trailforks.com/region/ellison-provincial-park/?lat=50.167969531486456&lon=-119.43355321884371&z=13&m=trailforks" class="nav" target="_blank">Trailforks.com</a> is a great site for all the trails in the area. They have detailed maps and stats, as well as videos, photos, and reports on conditions and hazards encountered by riders.

    <h3>Swimming
    </h3>
   <p>There are 3 distinct bays to choose from; Otter Bay, South Bay and Sandy Beach. The latter being mainly geared toward the dogs. All three have nice clean sandy beaches surrounded by shady treed areas. The water keeps warm in the summer with a gently sloping lake floor, and is safely surrounded by buoys to keep watercraft at a safe distance. But with no lifeguards on duty at Provincial Parks, please use caution and supervise novice swimmers. Another thing to mention is <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wat/wq/brochures/swimitch.html" class="nav" target="_blank">Swimmers itch</a> may be a possibility during warm summer months, personally I have never experienced it, but it results in an itchy skin rash and redness that usually lasts for a few days. Normally nothing to be to concerned with, can take precautions like avoiding shallow water and toweling off as soon as you get out of the lake.

    <h3>Scuba Diving
    </h3>
   <p>A feature that is not so commonly known to be an option at Ellison is freshwater scuba-diving. Otter Bay is one of the swimming areas here, and is also the site of western Canada's first freshwater scuba-diving and snorkeling park. With sunken boats and artifacts to explore, it is a highly recommended activity to experience!
