     </ol>

     <p class="quote">Some felines do not agree with the practice of doing such work. “My human feeds me, so why not feed my human? His opposable thumbs seem to have hindered his hunting abilities, so I need to step up and take care of him.” Kleo claims that “he would not survive without me.”

     <p class="quote">Quick dinner recipe ideas come to Kleo in her many naps throughout the day. Creating easy casseroles are her specialty. “Sometimes I improvise and use rodent meat, that’s the only way he seems to accept my gifts. What my human does not know will not hurt him.” Kleo lovingly proclaims.
