   <h2>Provincial Parks in Vernon</h2>
   
   <p>
    <img src="view.jpg" alt="Overlooking Vernon" width="400" height="300" class="floatleft">Have you ever just wanted to get away from it all, step out of the hustle and bustle of life and just enjoy the simple beauty of nature? Living in the North Okanagan, I am truly blessed with the opportunity to enjoy the quiet comforts of mother nature in no time at all. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon,_British_Columbia" class="nav" target="_blank">Vernon</a> is a truly unique city surrounded by rolling hills and three beautiful lakes being watched over by the Monashee Mountains. Approximately 40,000 people currently live here, but in less than a thirty minute drive you would never know it. No matter the time of year there are plenty of activities and unique landscapes to discover in Vernon. With the abundantly varying altitudes, even in spring and fall it is not uncommon to go snowboarding, mountain biking and golfing all in the same day. Swimming as well if you are looking to have a polar bear dip! It is truly amazing on how many outdoor activities and sights to see there are in this beautiful neck of the woods. With so many options, where does one start? It can be overwhelming for people that are not familiar with the area, and getting advice from your tour guide may prompt for a pricey vacation! Being a thrifty person myself, I would like to make some suggestions for those visiting the Vernon area.

   <p>As a local Vernonite, I want to offer some suggestions and insight into the must see Provincial Parks in the area. My top priority for free time is to get out and enjoy all that Mother Nature has to offer. Not only is it free, the fresh air and quiet atmosphere is a great way to relax and de-stress from the daily grind. Please take a moment and visit each of them with me, I would like to show you around my backyard!
