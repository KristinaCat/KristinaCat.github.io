   <h2>Silver Star Provincial Park</h2>
   
    <p>
     <img src="snow.jpg" alt="Silver Star snowy mountain view" width="400" height="290" class="floatleft"><a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/silver_star/silver-star-map.pdf?v=1479855522553" class="nav" target="_blank"> Silver Star Provincial Park</a> is over 5500 hectares, which contains, along with a ton of fresh untouched land, two fantastic places to visit; Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre, a great winter destination, and Silver Star Mountain Resort, a great destination all year round. It is mostly known for its amazing skiing opportunities, but there is so much more to experience, I will share some details on my favorites.
    </p>
    <p>Less than a 30 minute drive from downtown Vernon, you can be on top of the mountain overlooking the clouds blanketing the valley. It truly is a spectacular site to see. Having the sun shining on you as you gaze down at the clouds, it is quite surreal. Silver Star Resort has its own Village with many hotels, lodges and condos to rent, or even purchase if your wallet is deep enough. As well as multiple restaurants, bars, shops and even a bowling alley! This large mountain has a very small town community feel, and many people are proud to call it home all year round. There is plenty of wildlife that call it home as well, including moose, bears, deer, and even lynx. I must say that if you have never had the pleasure of meeting a moose in person, WOW, they sure can be big! But don't get your hopes up as it is not common to run into any of these while visiting Silver Star.

     <h3>Skiing/Snowboarding
     </h3>
    <p>There are over 130 trails as you can see on the <a href="http://www.skisilverstar.com/sites/default/files/atoms/files/AlpineMap.pdf" class="nav" target="_blank"> Alpine Map</a>, totaling over 1300 hectares of skiable terrain with 11 ski lifts to make your journey uphill more convenient, and some even run all year round for other activities. With an average of 23 feet of snowfall annually, there is no need for any snow-making; Mother Nature has got us covered, literally! From around the middle to end of November to April, weather permitting, you can hit the slopes that cover four mountain faces. Vance Creek is the place to be for beginners, and contains most of the intermediate runs. Attridge is located right beside Vance Creek and hosts a number of advanced glade runs. Silver Woods area caters to the intermediate skier/snowboarder, and Putman Creek area introduces the black diamond and double black diamond runs. Experienced snow men will appreciate the challenges that await here.
    </p>
    <p>Another challenge some may enjoy is Heli-Skiing. Silver Star boasts over 53,000 hectares of remote backcountry terrain that they would be happy to carry you and your skis to. You will be picked up and dropped off right at the village.  Must mention another treat to enjoy on Friday and Saturday evenings is night skiing. There are 4km of lit up trails to explore and it is truly a different feeling going down the mountain with the nights sky above.
    </p>
    <p>Of course cannot neglect to mention that the tobogganing here is delightful, as well as the pond to strap on your ice skates and practice your triple axel toe jump. The other must do snow activities to experience are; snowshoeing, snowmobiling and cross country skiing - which can also be found at Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre. Located right beside Silver Star Resort and truly is the best place to enjoy these activities, it is what they are known for.

    <h3>Biking
     </h3>
    <p>When the snow has left us, the fun continues with over 55 mountain biking trails at a total distance of more than 127 km. No wonder so many people call Silver Star home all year round, always something to do. There is a ski lift that runs in the summer for mountain bikers to utilize. Recommend that trail details should be researched prior to pedaling, <a href="http://www.trailforks.com/region/silver-star-mountain-resort/?lat=50.35713469842494&lon=-119.01443313078516&z=15&m=arc" class="nav" target="_blank">Trailforks</a> is an ideal place to check out for any hazards and interactive maps. The people that work here sure take pride in their jobs, you can see it in how well the trails are maintained. During the spring and summer months you will also find many competitions and promotional events held here. Plenty local and global biking gurus love to show off their skills here. Some of the trails are multiuse for hikers as well, so please just be smart and courteous to others as to not run them over or give them a heart attack by startling them. Also please be aware and watch out for bears. There seems to be a den near one of the trails, and mama bear would appreciate it if you would be a good neighbor and stay out of her and her families business. It is not Yogi and Booboo looking to have a picnic.
