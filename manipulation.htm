   <h1>Basic Image Manipulation
   </h1>
   
    <p>This first assignment was an introduction to Photoshop, the workspace and some of the basic tools it offers. A solid understanding of these basics is crucial to creating any successful Photoshop project.
    </p>
    <p>This exercise has taught me the importance of performing adjustments on images to prepare them for the web. Proper alignment, cropping and image size require only a little bit of work but in the big picture can make all the difference. The internet and its users have little patience, and even a few extra seconds of download time can cause them to look elsewhere. So when the size of the image can make or break a webpage, you really need to ensure that the files are fully optimized. The images below are a good example of the huge impact that can be made. Finding that sweet spot balance between file size and image quality may change depending on the website, but what doesn't change is that size does matter!

     <h2>Image 8a
     </h2>
     
     <p><img src="step8a.jpg" alt="First Boat Image" width="215" height="162" class="floatleft">
     </p>
     
      <ul>
       <li>Image 8a was optimized using the Photoshop "Save As..." function.
       </li>
       <li>Dimensions: 215px x 162px.
       </li>
       <li>File Size: 31.5k.
       </li>
       <li>Download Time at 56k: 4 seconds.
       </li>
       <li>I would prefer not to use this image for web presentation as it has not been optimized to the best of its ability.
       </li>
      </ul>

     <h2>Image 8b
     </h2>
     
     <p><img src="step8b.jpg" alt="Second Boat Image" width="215" height="162" class="floatleft">
     </p>
     
      <ul>
       <li>Image 8b was optimized using the Photoshop "Save For Web..." function.
       </li>
       <li>Dimensions: 215px x 162px.
       </li>
       <li>File Size: 9.28k.
       </li>
       <li>Download Time at 56k: 1 second.
       </li>
       <li>I would use this image for web presentation as it has been sufficiently optimized.
       </li>
