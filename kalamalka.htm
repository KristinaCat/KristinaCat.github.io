   <h2>Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park</h2>
   
    <p><img src="kallake.psd" alt="View of Lake" width="400" height="300" class="floatleft">This park is full of stunning panoramic views of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamalka_Lake" class="nav" target="_blank">Kalamalka Lake</a> and the surrounding valley. There are 3 main entrances to this 4209 hectare, largely undeveloped park, with all the trails intertwining at some point it really doesn't matter too much where you park. Yellow Gate has the largest parking lot area and is one of the most commonly used for picnicers and tourists. Cosens Bay Gate can fit about 20 cars and seems to be the most popular entrance used by bikers and local hikers. Red Gate entrance can hold about 10 cars and is commonly used by bikers, hikers, and dog walkers. It is quite a popular park and is known for its cliff diving off of the over 100 ft cliffs, but this is strongly discouraged due to hidden dangers that can be unseen below the waters surface. Many people have died here by jumping headfirst into a rock or even by just hitting the water wrong you can knock yourself out and not resurface. Extreme caution must be taken. With all the varying terrain here, no matter the season you can enjoy your time here. Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall there are activities for all! Tons of different wildlife and endangered species call Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park home. Deer, cougars, red fox, black bears and bats to name a few. This location is also a birdwatchers paradise, dozens of different species to discover. Reptiles are also abundant here, quite the variety of snakes including not so friendly ones like rattlesnakes. So, like anywhere in the backcountry, just be smart and don't stick your appendages into the unknown of dark crevices or wade in the long grass and you should be fine!

     <h3>Hiking
     </h3>
    <p>Here you can wander your way around more than 14 km of trails, get up to the top overlooking Cosens Bay and you will have to stop to catch your breath even if your lungs are not tired from the hike. Best to keep to the trails here though, not only to ensure no destruction to mother nature, but you don't want to come in contact with any lethal munitions! Around the Second World War, some areas around Vernon were used in military training operations, including Cosens Bay. When the war ended many still-lethal munitions were left behind. Not to worry, there are clearly marked signs in the applicable areas, but still best to stick to the trails. A lot of the trails are multiuse for hikers, bikers and horseback riders, so use appropriate etiquette and be respectful of others. The main trails include Bear Valley Trail, Coldstream Trail, Cosens Bay Trail, Grassland Trail and Juniper Trail. Ranging from 1km to 2.5km per trail, but as mentioned they all meet up at some point, so can truly customize your own hiking plan. Use the <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/kalamalka_lk/kalamalka_park.pdf?v=1479781020217" class="nav" target="_blank">Park Map</a>, or just wing it for an exciting adventure.

     <h3>Biking
     </h3>
    <p>Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park has some of the best variety of mountain biking trails in the area. The <a href="http://www.okcycling.com/trails" class="nav" target="_blank">North Okanagan Cycling Society</a> boasts "A huge variety of trails makes this a great destination for everyone! Trails range from easy cross-country like Gingerly to big aggressive all-mountain rides like Big Ed and 36DD". Truly something for everyone here with 97 trails to choose from all different lengths and difficulties. Riders often say that this is their go to place because of the diverse trail options the park has, a little bit of everything to please every mood.
    </p>
     <h3>Swimming
     </h3>
    <p>Cosens Bay, and the Twin Bays Juniper and Jade, all have nice swimming opportunities. Cosens Bay has coarse sand that extends well into the water, Juniper Bay is large and covered in nice fine sand, and Jade Bay has a small shore area that is not very beach like but still a great spot to jump in and cool off. Boats are kept a safe distance away with buoys, but while there is no boat launch at this park, it is not very far away if the urge strikes to try wakeboarding.
    </p>
     <h3>Winter Fun
     </h3>
    <p>Along with all of the spectacular Spring, Summer and Fall activities, you can find perfect conditions for snowshoeing and cross country skiing.</p>
