   <h1>Assignment 5 - Retouching Images
   </h1>
   
    <p>This page is a presentation of some skills I learned while completing this course. The task was to retouch three images and then provide details on what was done, and the new specifications. The images we had to choose from all had their own unique flaws; it was difficult to pick only three to work with! I was able to correct these pictures using a variety of tools such as the Clone Stamp, Burn, Dodge, Patch and many more. Displayed below you will find image thumbnails which when clicked, take you to the full image. I have also described in more detail what was done to each photo as well as the specifications of the new retouched image.

          <p>I used five tools to retouch this photograph. First I used the Clone Stamp Tool to rid the old photo of its white spots and marks. Using a small brush I zoomed in to make sure I did not miss any of the flaws. Then to even out the bright light on his face, I used the Burn Tool with a fairly large very soft brush and with the setting on highlights as well as midtones. To finish off balancing the shades, I modified the Brightness/Contrast slightly.</p>
         <p>Looking closer at the background of the photo I was not too happy with the texture. To correct this I used the Patch Tool and gave that spot a more even look. Last but not least, his eyes looked a little dead, so I used the Sharpen Tool to add a little bit of definition. Then resized and used the Save For Web Function.

         <td><p>The Wedding photo was the most fun out of these three. It was challenging but also very rewarding to see the final result. There were some quite noticeable issues that needed to be corrected. First step was to remove the extremely distracting couple walking on the beach. </p>
            <p>Using the Clone Stamp tool, I worked ever so carefully from side to side and gradually moving up as to keep the sand and waves on the right angle as well as the right shades. After successfully seeing them gone, I was able to concentrate on what else needed help. I removed the buoys from the water, as well as the persons head from the bottom left corner. </p>
            <p>The brides face was a little dark, so I used the Dodge tool to brighten it up a little bit. I then fixed her dress from where I removed the persons head, the color was not right so I used the Sponge Desaturate tool and removed the blue spot by working in the appropriate Channels.</p>
            <p>The grooms face was a little shiny, the Blur tool calmed it down just enough. I then adjusted the Curves and the Brightness/Contrast just a little bit to make the colours and shades pop a bit more. Adjusted the image size, and then saved for Web to optimize.</p>

         <td><p>The Battery building I found to be the most challenging. I could have taken it so much farther; my first instinct was to make it look like new. As I was working through it, I remembered the goal was to make it natural, so I decided to preserve the historical feel by doing very little to the building itself.</p>
         <p>First I used the Clone Stamp tool to remove most of the garbage, and the other small structure in the far back right. Then to make the picture less cluttered and have the focus not be drawn away from the building, I removed those distracting power lines and poles and cleaned up some of the buildings edges. The final step I decided to brighten up the sky a little. I first used the Magic Wand selection tool to create a layer that contained only the sky, and used the Sponge Tool with the saturate setting to let more blue come out. Last but not least, resized the image and then used the Save for Web feature for optimization.

      <p>The largest challenge I found while completing this assignment, was not to overdo it. It was tricky to know when to stop. Perhaps if a customer gives direction as to what they are looking for it would be a little easier to envision the desired final look. This final assignment showcases only a small fraction of the powers of Photoshop, and I can’t wait to fine tune my skills and get more comfortable with this awesome tool at my disposal!
