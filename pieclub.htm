		<h1>First Rule Of <span class="impact">&pi;</span> Club: Talk About <span class="impact">&pi;</span> Club!
		</h1>
  
			<p><span class="impact">&pi;</span> Club used to be taboo, but we are here to change that. Why keep something so tasty a secret?! All of the members that formed this group were brought up in households that would not talk about <span class="impact">&pi;</span> Club. Grandparents and parents alike pretended it did not exist although they were deeply involved with it. The thought behind the secrecy was to keep it exclusive and exciting. Well the new generation is keeping the basic premise the same, but now it's an inclusive club for learning and sharing skills and recipes. More people equals more fun and knowledge. Welcome to the new and improved <span class="impact">&pi;</span> Club!

				<h2>Image Map description and details
				</h2>
			
					<p>Step one, find a suitable image. Even though the idea of creating an Image Map Map was tempting, I found an image of pie pieces that inspired a story to go with it. The Image Map Map will have to wait.
					</p>
					<p>Now that I have my image and my delicious storyline, I can start the image mapping process. For this I decided to practice the process in a couple of different ways. First I tried out the shareware application "CoffeeCup Image Mapper", which was surprisingly easy. All you have to do is upload the image on their website, select the shape to use, and then trace around the hotspot area you want to create. After you trace out all the hotspots in your image, it will then generate the html code for you! It makes the process of using a polygon shape to map an image with many jagged edges super simple. It was ideal for this image of pie pieces that are all a little different shape and not smooth triangles. 
					</p>
					<p>Due to the simplicity of using the "CoffeeCup Image Mapper", for description purposes I will describe the mapping process as done in Photoshop. 
					</p>
					<p>After opening my image up in Photoshop, I cropped and resized the image then optimized the image using the save for web feature. Now, knowing that the top left of the image has the "X,Y" coordinates of "0,0", I need to locate the coordinates I want to use to create an invisible border around the objects in the image that I want use as hot areas. I then zoomed in on my image to get a better look at where i would place the invisible connect the dots. After making sure I had the Info Panel window active in Photoshop, I hovered my cursor over the edges of the object in my image where I want to contain the hotspot. The Info Panel gave me the "X,Y" coordinates I needed. Being a jagged and uneven object, I decided to follow the edges of it quite closely to make the hotspots mirror the shape and size of the pie pieces themselves, therefore I have quite a few coordinates. After plotting out and recording all of the coordinates for each hot area, I planned the HTML code. 
					</p>
					<p>The requirements for constructing the HTML code are;
					</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>img src="images/pieslice.jpg" : What image to use.</li>
							<li>usemap="#piechart" : What code to use to generate the hot areas.</li>
							<li>alt="Pie Chart Image Map" : What text to display if image is not displayed.</li>
							<li>width="261" height="300" : The size of the image.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p>Next is the code used to generate the hot areas on the image, and where they take the user to;
					</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>map name="piechart" : What this image map code applies to.</li>
							<li>area shape="poly" : What shape it is.</li>
							<li>coords="X1,Y1,X2,Y2...etc : What the sets of coordinates are that outline the hotspot.</li>
							<li>href="lemon.htm" : Where the hotspot goes when clicked.</li>
							<li>alt="Lemon Ginger Pie" : What alternate text to display if image is not displayed.</li>
							<li>title="Lemon Ginger Pie" : I added this to show text when the hotspot is hovered over.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p>By using and experimenting with Photoshop as well as the "CoffeeCup Image Mapper", I have concluded that for simple rectangle image mapping, I will stick with just using Photoshop. Finding the coordinates of a simple shape takes no time at all. However, when dealing with complex shapes, I will definitely be using "CoffeeCup Image Mapper" in the future. This program was quite easy to use and did it in a fraction of the time as compared to mapping out quite a few coordinates in Photoshop.
